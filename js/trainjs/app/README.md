## Welcome to Train

Node On Train is an MVC Web Framework, similar to Ruby on Rails


## Getting Started

1. At the command prompt, create a new Train application:
	   <tt>trainjs new myapp</tt> (where <tt>myapp</tt> is the application name)

2. Change directory to <tt>myapp</tt> and start the web server:
	   <tt>cd myapp; trainjs server</tt> (run with --help for options)

3. Go to http://localhost:1337/ and you'll see:
	   "Welcome aboard: You're riding Node on Train!"
